# Delivery Notes - Webchat with Conversations

**Project Location**: `~/Projects/webchat-with-conversations/`
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Ready for Testing

---

## What's Been Built

A standalone React application that adds conversation list functionality to `@botpress/webchat`. This allows users to:
- View all their conversations in a sidebar
- Switch between conversations by clicking
- Create new conversations
- See last message preview for each conversation

---

## Files Created

### Core Components (8 files)
```
src/components/
├── ConversationItem.tsx & .css           # Individual conversation in list
├── ConversationList.tsx & .css           # List container with pagination
├── ConversationListPanel.tsx & .css      # Collapsible sidebar wrapper
└── WebchatWithConversations.tsx & .css   # Main component (wraps @botpress/webchat)
```

### Data Layer (2 files)
```
src/hooks/
└── useConversationList.ts                # Hook for fetching/managing conversations

src/types/
└── conversation.ts                       # TypeScript interfaces
```

### Configuration (4 files)
```
.env.example                              # Environment template
README.md                                 # Complete documentation
src/App.tsx                               # Demo application

## To Deliver to Client

### Option 1: Entire Project (Recommended)
```bash
cd ~/Projects
zip -r webchat-with-conversations.zip webchat-with-conversations \
  -x "*/node_modules/*" "*/dist/*" "*/.git/*"
```

Send `webchat-with-conversations.zip` with instructions:
1. Extract zip
2. Run `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add Client ID
4. Run `npm run dev` to test
5. Run `npm run build` for production

### Option 2: Components Only
If client has existing React app, send only:
- `src/components/` folder
- `src/hooks/useConversationList.ts`
- `src/types/conversation.ts`
- Installation note: `npm install @botpress/webchat @botpress/webchat-client`

---

## Client Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Botpress Client ID
- Log into Botpress Dashboard
- Go to bot → Integrations → Webchat
- Copy the Webhook ID (this is the Client ID)

### 2. Configure Environment
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set:
VITE_BOTPRESS_CLIENT_ID=<their-webhook-id>
```

### 3. Test Locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
# Deploy dist/ folder to hosting
```

---

## Integration Options

### Standalone Deployment
- Build project and deploy to Vercel/Netlify/AWS
- Give client the URL
- Fully functional conversation interface

### Embed in Existing Site
Client can import the component:

```tsx
import { WebchatWithConversations } from './path/to/component'

function TheirApp() {
  return (
    <WebchatWithConversations
      clientId="their-client-id"
      configuration={{
        botName: 'Their Bot',
        themeColor: '#their-color',
      }}
      enableConversationList={true}
    />
  )
}
```

---

## Technical Details

### API Usage
- **Initial Load**: 6 API calls (1 for list + 5 for previews)
- **Pagination**: Additional calls as user scrolls
- **Conversation Switch**: Existing webchat handles this

### Performance
- Lightweight (uses existing `@botpress/webchat` under the hood)
- No custom API client needed
- Optimized preview fetching (only first 5 conversations)

### Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile responsive
- Requires JavaScript enabled

---

## What Works

✅ List user's conversations
✅ Show last message preview
✅ Click to switch conversation
✅ Create new conversation
✅ Collapsible sidebar (mobile-friendly)
✅ Timestamps ("2m ago", "1h ago")
✅ Active conversation highlighting
✅ Pagination (Load More button)
✅ Loading states
✅ Error handling

---

## What's NOT Included (By Design)

❌ Search conversations (API doesn't support)
❌ Unread message counts (API doesn't provide)
❌ Custom conversation titles (uses message preview instead)
❌ Delete conversations from UI
❌ Conversation settings/metadata

These were intentionally excluded due to API limitations documented in the PRD.

---

## Testing Checklist

Before delivering, verify:
- [ ] Can create new conversation
- [ ] Can switch between conversations
- [ ] Messages load correctly after switch
- [ ] Sidebar collapses/expands
- [ ] Works on mobile (responsive)
- [ ] "Load More" button works (if >10 conversations)
- [ ] Client ID from environment variable works

---

## Support & Customization

### Styling
All components use plain CSS files that can be customized:
- Colors, fonts, spacing easily changed
- Uses standard CSS custom properties
- No CSS-in-JS, no complex setup

### Configuration
The `Configuration` object accepts all standard `@botpress/webchat` props:
- `botName`, `botAvatar`, `botDescription`
- `themeColor`, `composerPlaceholder`
- `showTimestamp`, `enableFileUpload`
- And more...

### Extending
Client can:
- Modify component styles (CSS files)
- Add custom features (fork the code)
- Change conversation list UI (modify components)
- Add analytics tracking (in component event handlers)

---

## Deployment Examples

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm run build
vercel --prod
```

### Netlify
```bash
npm run build
netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
```

### AWS S3 + CloudFront
```bash
npm run build
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://their-bucket/
```

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

Include in client communication:

**Problem**: "Failed to connect"
- **Solution**: Verify Client ID is correct and bot is published

**Problem**: Conversations don't appear
- **Solution**: Check browser console for API errors, verify webchat integration is enabled

**Problem**: Styling looks off
- **Solution**: Ensure all CSS files are imported correctly

**Problem**: TypeScript errors
- **Solution**: Run `npm install --save-dev @types/react @types/react-dom`

## Questions for Client

Before delivery, confirm:
- Do they have a Botpress bot with webchat integration?
- Do they have their Client ID (webhook ID)?
- Do they need standalone deployment or integration into existing site?
- Any specific branding/styling requirements?
- Any additional features they need?
